# Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a React Native app for iOS and Android that allows users to create decks, add cards and quiz themselves.

It uses React Native, Expo, Redux, & React Navigation.

This app is the third of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/deeppsy/mobileFlashcards.git
$ cd mobileFlashcards
$ expo start
```

## Usage

The project can be run with npm or yarn

This will open Expo Developer Tools in the browser. You can then do one of the following.

- Use your device to test:

  Scan the QR Code using the Expo Client app ([Expo Client for Android & iOS](https://expo.dev/client)) from an Android or iOS device. Choose the device you're on and download, then scan the QR code given to you from the terminal after starting the application.
